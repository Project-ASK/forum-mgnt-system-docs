* Including the created_by and timestamps facilitates user tracking and audit purposes.

*Further Enhancements:*

* You can add a color column to categorize events visually.
* Implement user permissions to control who can create, edit, or delete events.
* Integrate the calendar with a notification system to remind users about upcoming events.

This table design provides a foundation for managing events across multiple forums, catering to different user roles and ensuring efficient event planning and information dissemination.
